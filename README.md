# Vue Basics

### A simple app that lists the books and its author

The books in the pink containers are marked favorite.

Click on the container to change the favorite preferences.

This app is built as part of Vue JS course by [NET NINJA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) and the [COURSE](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-vuejs-firebase/).
